Essentials Performance Benchmarks
=================================

There are performance benchmarks for some of the library classes.

Each benchmark is running in separate JVM with warming up. 

Running
-------

To run all benchmarks from the root project use:

    ./gradlew java-essentials-performance:allBenchmarks    

It's possible to run each benchmark separately with corresponding task. See [benchmarks.gradle](benchmarks.gradle) for the list of benchmarks.
